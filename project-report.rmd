# Decision
Would German apple farmers include chicken into their apple plantation in order to deal with the programmed banning of certain agro chemicals especially herbicides in the coming years?

# Introduction
Chicken in apple plantation is an agroforestry practice. The integration of poultry with crops and/or trees production has been identified as a sustainable way to increase the productivity of land and to provide a number of ecosystem services and environmental benefits compared to disaggregated agricultural and woodland systems [@smith2013reconciling]. Literature shows that the outdoor range is in general better used when they had more trees or hedges and the number of birds ranging outside is correlated with the percentage tree cover on the range [@hemery2005novel].
The main benefits to chickens arising from the use of trees are potential changes to the microclimate and animal welfare [@berg2002health]. Chickens kept outside exhibit signs of reduced stress, as evidenced by less pecking damage [@bestman2020predation]. Trees can provide a welfare benefit depending on the sizes and numbers of trees and poultry [@yates2007economic].  They offer an environment closer to that of the jungle fowl from which chicken breeds are descended and the opportunity to express natural behavior [@berg2002health]. In particular, trees provide shade from the sun, dry areas for dust bathing, shelter from aerial predators and from ground predators approaching from the side [@bestman2003farm].  In existing ‘free-range’ egg or meat systems poultry are reluctant to range and only 14% of birds range at one time [@dawkins2003makes].
The trees can also provide a means of escaping from aggressive behaviour as well as the reduction of visual stimuli that provoke aggression. An increase in the environmental diversity or behavioral enrichment can also increase welfare standards for animals as it permits the expression of frustrated behavioral motivations [@broom1988scientific]. Organic and free-range poultry have, besides having access to a hen house, access to an outdoor run. In this respect, it is well known that poultry are more inclined to use the range when it is enriched with trees, and that in turn feather picking is reduced when more hens use the range [@bestman2003farm]. Thus the establishment of trees in the outdoor run is considered to improve hen welfare. 
Another associated benefit of the system is the provision of valuable revenue streams from commercial tress (apples) and the sales of chicken products (eggs) [@yates2007economic]. Markets for products that have been produced in systems that offer welfare and or environmental benefits and that are perceived as more ‘natural’, have grown substantially in recent years in many countries, particularly in Western Europe. In the UK, freerange eggs (i.e. produced in a system where birds have access to pasture) account for 27% of all eggs produced (DEFRA 2005a) and are retailed at a premium of 22% and 147% compared to conventional ‘barn’ and ‘caged’ produced eggs respectively (British Egg Information Service pers. comm. 2002) [@yates2007economic].
[@brownlow2000alternatives] give the following specific reasons for considering such systems:
i). The significant growth in outdoor poultry enterprises (such as free-range egg production) leading to increased demands on land resources.  ii). Recognition of the use of tree cover to improve the welfare conditions of outdoor poultry. iii).The potential for exploiting markets for ‘forest-reared’ poultry. iv). Increasing demands on forest managers to find new uses for forest resources and alternative methods for the silvicultural treatment of tree crops.
Additional benefits of the system is that, where there is more tree cover, fewer water birds will enter. This is critical as water birds can transmit avian influenza virus [@bestman2018presence]
Chickens may reduce scab and pest insects by eating leaves infected with scab and insects [@timmermans2016quality]. 

Despite the numerous benefits of the system, there are associated challenges and uncertainties which hampers its effectiveness. Notable among the challenges includes gradual decrease of chicken benefits with distance to coop [@timmermans2016quality]. Weed control is very effective when the chicken are close to the plantation (48m). However, this is reduce when the coop is far (198m) from the plantation (198m)[@timmermans2016quality]. Few studies on disease and pest reduction (and unclear observations) estimations of inputs. Another uncertainty is such that, reducing the occurrence of insects, disease and pest does not linearly translate to decrease in controlling these  [@timmermans2016quality], [@yates2007economic]

Combining animals (laying hens) with trees has numerous benefits, however, there also associated challenges and uncertainties. The purpose of our project is to create a decision model for an organic orchards (chicken in apple plantations) that  allows expert knowledge to be included in the calculations of benefits and uncertainties (such as pest suppression) to be explicitly based on expert assessments instead of lengthy measurements.

# Stakeholders
Our stakeholders are the people who will directly or indirectly benefit form the decision model. They Include;Farmers (apple and chicken), Retailers, Consumers, Non-governmental organizations (NGOs).

## Decision Maker
Farmers with already established, conventional commercial apple farmer in NW Europe. Farmers are key decision makers because of the Net Present Value (NPV) calculation in the model. This is a variable which is more important to the producers (farmer).

## Interview with Farmers
Pursuant to our project, we reached out to conventional apple and chicken farmers on our decision to include poultry in apple orchards. We explained to them a particular advantage of our decision model as it allows expert knowledge to be included in the calculations and uncertainties (such as pest suppression) to be explicitly based on expert assessments instead of lengthy measurements. 
For this purpose, we created an impact model, which should calculate results for various assumptions. For example, we try to capture the financial benefits of the farms through the sale of the eggs as well as effects that are more difficult to calculate, such as savings in plant protection through the "help" of the chickens.

Court Farms Chickens in United Kingdom (UK), a farm currently keeping all their birds in apple, cherry and plum orchards rather than in fields. In an interview with the Farm Manager, he mentioned some of the few reasons they are actively practicing the system. According him, the land is cheaper, the trees provide natural cover and shelter which enables the birds display much more natural behaviour and are happier. The roots in the ground provide stability and drainage in the winter and which helps prevent the land turning into a mud bath is an environmental benefit that the system provides, he said.
On the other hand, he expressed his displeasure in the system, he mentioned that, it difficult to install fencing because of the trees and roots. Again trunks of trees needs to be protected from hens. He iterated that fallen fruit is fine to be eaten by the birds but they have to monitor the amount as too much will make them ill so it has to be manually collected each morning and also becomes difficult to harvest the trees with the birds, coops and fencing now in the way.
He further mentioned that, plum stones when eaten by turkeys and chicken can induce cyanide poisoning. 

The Human Resource (HR) and Recruitment Director of AC Gotham and Son farms in the UK pointed out that, chicken in apple orchards is a system that they are unfortunately, not willing to consider. According to him, there are the practical implications of protecting the chickens from natural predators such as foxes, however, the consideration of what they would do with all the eggs laid across the 3000 acres of orchards they have.


## Feeding our model (Inputs)
With our input table, we reached out to the farmers to provide us with expert information based on some estimates from their point of view for our input table (minimum value + maximum value) in the case of 1200 chickens, stocked with pullets and one mobile house in a conventional apple orchard. The experts estimates were inputs we believed would be interesting and fantastic to feed our model with. However, responses from the farmers was not forthcoming. That not withstanding, we relied on business case studies for estimates. Again we also made reference to evidence from reports which at the end enabled us to self-estimate of inputs to feed our model.


# Conceptual Model

The conceptual model of the decision to include chicken into the apple orchard consists out of two main parts (refer to picture). The first covers the direct costs and benefits of the to be included chicken. Costs consist out of the investment costs and the running costs. Under investment costs falls mainly the infrastructure necessary to keep the chicken which are a mobile chicken house and fencing. Running costs are the recurring cost items of keeping chicken. These are namely the egg-laying hens bought, fodder and bedding, costs of the veterinarian, energy and water, maintenance cost of the housing, costs associated to market the chicken products (like finding a seller for the chicken produce), costs of the animal insurance and additional labor costs. These cost items were expressed on basis per chicken kept, so that they are scaleable. Furthermore, we included the risk of avian influenza which can either occur in the neighborhood of the establishment or within the chicken flock. Either way, it mainly increases the running costs, as there are certain protocols and procedures to follow in these cases putting extra burden on the management. In the neighborhood case, the farmer has to keep the chicken strictly indoor and test the chicken regularly. In case of avian influenza the whole flock needs to be slaughtered. Since the insurance covers for the loss of the chicken value and the forgone revenue by the chicken products, we assumed that avian influenza does not affect the revenue part of our model. Direct benefits of the chicken include the laid eggs throughout the year and the 'old' chicken at the end of the year sold for meat. These are modified by the prices for the produce, the period length of egg-laying and the egg-output per chicken. Furthermore the share of marketable eggs and the 'survival' rate of the chicken affect the benefits. The total direct revenue of keeping chicken in the orchard are calculated by subtracting the costs from the benefits. 

The other component of the model consists out of the apple orchard. In our project we decided to include all aspects of the apple orchard even if not amended by the presence of chicken. So similar to the chicken part, it consists out of the costs and benefits of growing apple, with the difference that the orchard is already established and thus there are no initial investments. Benefits come mainly from the apple harvested and sold, which are modified by the apple price and yield. Costs were differentiated between items affected by the chicken and chicken-independent ones. Chicken independent running costs included pruning, fertilization and apple harvest. Chicken modified costs include the mowing of the lawn in between the apple rows, the weeding within the bare soil strip of the apple rows as well as costs for control of voles, fungal diseases like apple scab and harmful insects like the apple sawfly. 

The unaltered apple orchard costs serve as a baseline to compare the effect of the chicken keeping intervention. In case of the intervention, it is assumed that the cost to control of voles, insect and apple scab are reduced. This can be seen as a synergistic effect of the combined apple and chicken system. If the avian influenza case happens, the benefits of having the chicken in the orchard are set to zero for this year. In the current state of the model, no trade-off effects are included, so chicken and apple in all cases benefit from each other, which seems in hindsight unrealistic. Potential trade-offs like chicken harming trees in their proximity by scratching and foraging should be included in future work on the model. When we formulated the conceptual model we were also interested on scale of The initial idea of including them was to get a feeling of the income proportion of apple and chicken subsystem. But to answer the question whether to add the chicken to orchard, every non-interacting component of the apple subsystem is reduntant and could be excluded in a more refined version of the model.

# Coded model

The model is structured similar to the graphical model. At first the cost and then the benefits of the apple subsystem are calculated, followed by the expenses and income of the chicken subsystem. In both subsystems the cost items are expressed per tree / chicken. Especially variables covering prices or work time were varied within the years using `vv()`. In case of apple scab, harmful insect control and voles a chance for an especially bad year was included using `chance_event()` and a variable stating by how many percent the control costs increase in case of the event. Furthermore, in case of the event, a yield reduction of the apple trees is assumed. We assumed that these events happen independent from each other, so it is also possible that in an especially unfortunate year all these events happen at the same time. The yield reduction factor is in these cases 'collected' and then applied to reduce the regular yield. Impact of voles on trees were handle differently than apple scab and insect. We assumed that voles kill individual tree by damaging the rootstock. So in case of voles, we assumed that a certain share of the trees die in event of a 'bad' vole year. Furthermore, we assumed that newly planted trees for the first three years do not yield any apples and for the following three years only a lower amount of apples than fully mature apple trees. Yield of young and mature trees were calculated independent from each other. To keep track of the three tree populations (no yield, reduced yield and full yield) a function was written (`calc_tree_population()`). It takes the vector of the `chance_event()` for voles as an input and returns the quantity of mature and young trees as output. In case of apple scab, insect, voles, weeding and mowing, the presence of chicken in the orchard was assumed to be beneficial. To keep the calculations simple, we assumed that the costs of control were reduced but the yield was left unaltered. After havin calculated the costs, the benefits of the apple subsystem was calculated by multiplying the tree populations with yield per tree and apple price.

In the second step costs and benefits of the chicken subsystem were calculated. Most noteworthy is again a `chance_event()` for the two cases of avian influenza: either in neighborhood or within the flock. Since the function was applied for both events independently, there was a small chance that in one year both yield a positive value. In that case the more severe case outweighs and the malus for management cost is only increased by the factor of the flock scenario. In either case the synergistic effect of chicken and apple on the control cost were set to zero for the influenza years because the chickens were kept indoors / were slaughtered. Additional to the threat of avian influenza, we also had a general threat that the chicken might not survive the year in our model, expressed as `survival_rate`. However, in the case of 'regular' death it is assumed that the chicken die right away at the first day, do not produce any eggs or consume any fodder or dirty any bedding. Furthermore, it is assumed that the farmer buys chicken at a yearly basis, even though the high productive egg-laying period is somewhat shorter.

At the end of the model, revenues of the apple subsystem are subtracted from the combined system to model the additional money earned / lost by the decision to include chicken to the apple orchard.

<!-- ask in wednesday office hour if they want us to implement their feedback (effect of chicken on apple yield) -->

<!-- mention that some variables were assumed to be constant (like the years until full yield for apple, the total number of trees or the size of the chicken flock) -->

# Model Outcome Outcome

first plot to show distributions of apple vs apple + chicken. they are very similar because the absolute impact of chicken is relatively low

<!-- only apple vs apple +  chicken plot here here -->

```{r,echo = FALSE,fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('pictures/density_apple-chicken.jpg')

```

In the next plot you can see the direct revenue of the chicken subsystem `chicken direct benefit` plotted against the simulated synergies `synergies`. While the direct benefits of keeping the chicken is subject to some risk as roughly a third of the density plot is negative, the synergies are strictly positive. Furthermore, the synergistic effect are much higher than the direct benefits. This raises doubts if the current parameter choices are accurate.

<!-- you can see that I tried to recreate the look of the density plots here, -->

```{r,echo = FALSE,fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('pictures/density_synergy.jpeg')

```


write about the density plot of inclduding chicken to the apple orchard. extremely positive, probably because we overestimated the positive effect of the chicken on the orhard

```{r,echo = FALSE,fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('pictures/density_decision_do.jpeg')

```

next comes a plot on the cashflow. we see that after the initial investment the cashflow stabilizes but variability of income is still large in the following years

```{r,echo = FALSE,fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('pictures/cashflow_decision.jpeg')

```

I am still curious how the cashflow looks like if the we investigate the cummulative cashflow. Maybe I can make a plot on that aswell to see how long on average it takes to come even.

```{r,echo = FALSE,fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('pictures/dummy_picture.jpg')

```

The second part is about the PLS analysis on the decision do part. then we can see some bar charts on that.biggest drives propably are the cost benefits of chicken in the orchard

```{r,echo = FALSE,fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('pictures/pls_decision.jpeg')

```

finally we will have a plot on the evpi for decision do. since right now everything is mostly positive, there is not much interesting to see

```{r,echo = FALSE,fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('pictures/dummy_picture.jpg')

```
